# Pokémon EvoYellow

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Yellow with bonus features; Pikachu now evolves, and all pokemon now follow as of version v3.
+ Play as girl or boy
+ Cute Raichu graphics when you evolve Pikachu.
+ Ride pokemon on a saddle
+ Press B to run
+ Can complete the Pokedex.
+ Over 200 pokemon, many Johto but also new Kanto evolutions have been added. All Eeveelutions available. A couple Demo-mon (Rinrin and Berurun as dark/ghost kitties, Bombseeker the fire/water, and Turban, an alt-Shelder evo) from the Gold/Silver Special Demo have been added, with stats borrowed from existing pokemon: if you hate them you don't have to use 'em.
+ More moves, like Crunch
+ Some moves have been tweaked; Wrap no longer traps you forever, Dragon Rage causes rage effect.
+ More types, Dark, Steel, Fairy
+ Slightly different TMs, to reflect the new types.
+ Different kinds of shinies, get Pink, Blue, Black, Yellow, Purple, Orange/red
+ Hold items for Pokemon (very very basic, use 'give' from item menu)
+ New Area, Mt. Silver
+ Slight difficulty curve adjustment, with larger anime-inspired Teams for Gym Leaders, example: Brock has Vulpix, Misty has Corsola and Togekiss
+ OLDER versions (below 3.3) had type re-adjustments, moving toward possibly utilizing special area-only or item induced morphs instead, as I know some people really hate type changes. Eevee version as of this writing still has the weird typings though.
+ Uses Dannye's Gen 2 Sprites version of the Yellow disassembly as a base; so, updated sprites. Exception is Yellow's Pikachu sprite; that one I revamped myself.

I'm currently fiddling with version 3.3 so don't be surprised to see it change one more time.
