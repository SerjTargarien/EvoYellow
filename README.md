# Pokémon EvoYellow

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Yellow with bonus features; Pikachu now evolves, and all pokemon now follow as of version v3.
+ Play as girl or boy
+ Cute Raichu graphics when you evolve Pikachu.
+ Ride pokemon on a saddle
+ Press B to run
+ Can complete the Pokedex.
+ Over 200 pokemon, many Johto but also new Kanto evolutions have been added. All Eeveelutions available.
+ More moves, like Crunch
+ Some moves have been tweaked; Wrap no longer traps you forever, Dragon Rage causes rage effect.
+ More types, Dark, Steel, Fairy
+ Different kinds of shinies, get Pink, Blue, Black, Yellow, Purple, Orange/red
+ Hold items for Pokemon (very very basic, slightly buggy!)
+ New Area, Mt. Silver
+ Slight difficulty curve adjustment, with larger anime-inspired Teams for Gym Leaders, example: Brock has Vulpix, Misty has Corsola and Togekiss
+ Some type re-adjustments; Sunflora is now fire/grass, for instance, turning it from a weak boring pokemon into a more viable one. Many Alola typings have been put into play.
+ Uses Dannye's Gen 2 Sprites version of the Yellow disassembly as a base; so, updated sprites. Exception is Yellow's Pikachu sprite; that one I revamped myself.

It builds the following rom:

* Pokemon Yellow (UE) [C][!].gbc  `md5: d9290db87b1f0a23b89f99ee4469e34b`
